# Dion Baskara - Portfolio

This project was completed in order to both learn and utilize the techniques I have been learning. This page will also someday function as a true web
development portfolio as I begin to populate it with more deployed apps.

## Description

This webpage will function as my portfolio to showcase the work I have done as a web developer. It will highlight projects I have completed in order
to show potential employers the skills that I have as a developer. It will act as a continually expanding repertoire that can follow me through my
career as I learn more advanced skills.
